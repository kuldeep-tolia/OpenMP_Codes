Problem Description:  

-> Consider the calculation of the derivative of the following function,  
$$f(x) = sin(5x), \hspace{4mm} 0 \leq x \leq 5$$  
using $4^{th}$ order accurate Pade scheme for the interior and $3^{rd}$ order accurate one-sided Pade scheme near the boundaries.  
-> Pade's scheme is given as:  
$$f'_0 + 2f'_1 = \frac{1}{h} \left( -\frac{5}{2}f_0 + 2f_1 + \frac{1}{2}f_2 \right)$$  

$$f_{j-1} = 1$$

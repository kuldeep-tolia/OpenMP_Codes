Problem Description:  

-> This is a program to integrate a given function numerically using the Simpson's rule. Consider evaluation of the following integral:  
$$I = \int_{1}^{\pi} \frac{sin(x)}{2x^3} \hspace{1mm} dx$$  
-> The exact value of the integration $I = 0.198573$.  
-> The Simpson's rule can be expressed using the following equation:  
$$I \approx 1$$

Problem Description:  

-> In this problem, the objective is to develope the OpenMP version of the Jacobi-iterative method.  
-> To simplify the problem, I have considered a system of linear equations $Ax=b$. The matrix $A$ is a tri-diagonal matrix and the coefficients on the sub, main, and super diagonals are constant and equal to (-1, 2, -1).  
-> d
